### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Siraaj based in Cape Town, South Africa and I am an aspiring Software Developer learning through CodeSpace and the World Wide Web. I really enjoy delving into programming languages such as CSS, JavaScript and mark ups such as HTML. I also enjoy doing designing in general which brings out my creative nature.
